# Empress

Empress is a library of classes for easier WordPress development.

## Goals:

Creation of this library follows many objectives which are listed below and hopefully will extend over time:

1. **Snippets of WordPress related tasks.** There are some tasks/operations which are needed almost in every wordpress project, googling them always is both time consuming and unproductive. Keeping snippets in plain text format becomes messy and unorganized and leads to copy-paste programming; but having these tasks organized in an object oriented manner helps to maximize reusability.
2. **Vital widgets collection.** WordPress site contains hundreds of thousand of plugins and themes, and finding a good plugin for a specific scenario or requirement is time consuming. Moreover, downloaded plugins, often, are not free and/or lake certain features. To solve this problem this library must include common/popular functionality that plugins provide, things like Post like/dislike feature etc.
3. **Extensible and PSR compliant.** Library should be designed in a way such that using other libraries does not clutter it, by using, PSRs. Using composer we can use packagist's packages.


## Plans/features:
### Widgets:
1. Each widget should contain its css/js assets.
